       "['In the first chapter of \"Animal Farm\" by George Orwell, the animals on Manor Farm gather to hear a wise pig named Old Major deliver a speech about the oppression they face at the hands of humans. Old Major encourages the animals to rebel against their human masters, emphasizing the need for unity and equality among all animals. He shares a dream he had about a future where animals live free from human tyranny. The chapter ends with the animals singing a revolutionary song called \"Beasts of England\" before Mr. Jones, the farm owner, interrupts their gathering with a gunshot.',\n",

They destroy all reminders of human oppression and establish their own rules, including the Seven Commandments of Animalism. The animals then begin the work of harvesting the hay, with the pigs taking on leadership roles in organizing the tasks.',\n",
       " 'In the third chapter of Animal Farm, the animals work hard to harvest the hay, with the pigs directing and supervising the work. The harvest is a great success, and the animals experience a newfound happiness and sense of ownership over their labor. The pigs take on leadership roles and organize committees for various tasks. The animals also engage in literacy classes, with the pigs and some other animals becoming proficient readers. Napoleon takes responsibility for educating the young puppies, and the pigs begin to consume the milk and apples, justifying it by claiming it is necessary for their health and essential to the management of the farm.']"
